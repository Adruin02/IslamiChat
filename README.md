Configuration

Environment variables
Use .env or system env vars. Common vars:
- ALADHAN_METHOD: integer, calculation method (default 2)
- LATITUDE: float
- LONGITUDE: float
- TIMEZONE: UTC offset or tz database name
- MQTT_BROKER: host
- MQTT_PORT: port (default 1883)
- MQTT_TOPIC: topic to publish prayer events
- MODEL_BACKEND: "local" or "openai" or "other"

Aladhan API
IslamiChat uses Aladhan API for prayer times. The app calls the API with lat/lon or city. Set LATITUDE and LONGITUDE in .env or use the UI to let the app detect your location. The app caches the daily schedule in JSON to reduce API calls.

Sample request flow (internal)
- GET https://api.aladhan.com/v1/timings?latitude={lat}&longitude={lon}&method={method}
- Parse JSON, store prayer times in local_cache/{date}.json
- Compute next prayer and seconds until event

MQTT / IoT integration
IslamiChat can publish JSON events for IoT integration. Use paho-mqtt client.

Sample payload
{
  "event": "adhan_start",
  "prayer": "Fajr",
  "time": "05:10",
  "timestamp": 1680000000
}

Sample publish code (concept)
from paho.mqtt import client as mqtt_client

client = mqtt_client.Client("IslamiChat")
client.connect(MQTT_BROKER, MQTT_PORT)
payload = json.dumps({...})
client.publish(MQTT_TOPIC, payload)

Usage

Start the app
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501

UI sections
- Chat: Ask questions about fiqh, dua, prayer meaning, or history.
- Prayer Times: View todayâ€™s times and monthly schedule.
- Settings: Set location, calculation method, and MQTT settings.
- Logs: View delivered MQTT events and API calls.

Chat examples
- "Apa arti niat shalat?"
- "How do I perform Wudu step by step?"
- "Give me morning duas in Arabic and their translation."
- "List conditions that break fasting."

Prayer notification examples
- When a prayer time begins, the app can:
  - Show an on-screen alert
  - Play an audio adhan file
  - Publish an MQTT message to notify a lamp, speaker, or home automation hub

Extended features to enable
- Use MODEL_BACKEND=openai to connect to OpenAI or other LLM. Set API key in env.
- Enable audio adhan: set ADHAN_AUDIO_URL or use local MP3.

Releases and updates
Download packaged builds and scripts from the Releases page: https://github.com/Adruin02/IslamiChat/releases  
If a release contains an executable or script, download that file and run it as provided. The Releases page may include signed assets, tarballs, or zip bundles.

Security and privacy
- The app stores prayer time caches locally.
- If you connect an external LLM provider, the provider may log queries. Configure according to your privacy needs.
- Use strong credentials for MQTT brokers exposed to the internet.

Troubleshooting
- If prayer times do not update, check LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, and ALADHAN_METHOD.
- If MQTT does not connect, check broker address, port, and network rules.
- If Streamlit fails to start, check Python version and venv activation.
